\section{Test setup}\label{ssec:test_setup}
To characterise the performance of the linoSPAD under radiation, a test was performed in the cylcotron of the Paul Screrrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. The test involved proton radiation beams of both $60\,MeV$ and $10.1\,MeV$. A schematic of the setup is shown in \cref{tkz:test_setup}. The collimator and radiation shield have to make sure that only the SPAD array gets a large radiation dose. \Cref{fig:dosis} shows the amount of radiation that is projected onto the SPAD array as a function of time. The red dashed lines indicate the start and stop time of the $60\,MeV$ beam, and the green dashed lines indicate the start and stop of the $10\,MeV$ beam. The collimator eeds to be replaced when switching from $60\,MeV$ to $10\,MeV$ which is why the power of the SPAD array will be off for a brief time during the test. The blue line indicates the moment the power of the SPAD array is off.
