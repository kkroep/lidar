\section{linoSPAD}\label{ssec:linoSPAD}
To characterise the performance of the $0.18\,\mu s$ technology SPADs. The LinoSPAD as developed by Sammuel Burri et al. features a SPAD array of this type. therefore the LinoSPAD was used to test it's resilience against radiation. \Cref{tkz:schematic_linoSPAD} shows a simple schematic of the linoSPAD. Note that the SPAD array is isolated from the readout electronics and FPGA. This is convenient for testing with a radiation beam that can be that can be directed to the SPAD array and away from the sensitive ROIC and FPGA. This layout is also useful to shield of the ROIC and FPGA using e.g. blocks of lead.

The software used to read out the linoSPAD is programmed to count the photons for each individual SPAD for a duration of one second and store this information in a file. This operation is called every minute.
