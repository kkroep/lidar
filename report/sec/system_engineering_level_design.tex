\section{System engineering level design} 
\label{sec:system_engineering_level_design}
In this section a system engineering level design is constructed that meets the performance requirements stated in \cref{sec:high_level_specifications}. \Cref{ssec:overview} shall provide an overview of the system, \cref{ssec:assumptions} shall list the assumptions made, and \cref{ssec:trade_offs_and_methodology} shall elaborate on trade-offs and design decisions.
