\subsection{Resolution} 
\label{ssec:resolution}
The requirement for the altimetry mode changes based on the height. The target is a resolution of at least $0.1\,\%$. To ensure that this requirement is met, both the largest altitude of $8\,km$, and the smallest altitude of $500\,m$ will be investigated.

The minimum resolution for the largest and shortest altitude are $8\,m$ and $0.5\,m$ respectively. The maximum allowable FWHM can be calculated using \cref{eq:max_FWHM}.
 Using \cref{eq:FWHM_sigma} the maximum standard deviation can be calculated. The calculations are performed

\begin{align}\label{eq:max_FWHM}
FWHM_{max} = \frac{2x}{c}
\end{align}
