The maximum allowable $FWHM$ of the measurement is $333\,ps$ as shown in \cref{ssec:assumptions}. Using \cref{eq:FWHM_sigma} the maximum standard deviation is $\sigma=141\,ps$.

\begin{align}\label{eq:sigma_FWHM}
	FWHM   &= 2\sqrt{2\ln2}\sigma \\
	\sigma &= \frac{FWHM}{2\sqrt{2\ln2}}\label{eq:FWHM_sigma}
\end{align}

The power of the background noise leaving the surface of interest at europa is calculated in \cref{ssec:background_noise}, and is $P_B = 0.179\,W$. However, this is the power at Europa. One can use \cref{eq:europa_SPAD} to calculate the amount of power that hits the SPADs.

\begin{align}
	P_B' &= \frac{P_B}{2\pi r^2}\cdot R_{europa}\cdot \pi D_l\cdot L_fL_l\\
		 &= \frac{P_BR_{europa}D_lL_fL_l}{2r^2} \label{eq:europa_SPAD}
\end{align}
~\\
where $P_B'$ is the background noise at the SPADs, \\
$r$ the altitude of the sensor, \\
$R_{europa}$ the reflectivity of Europa, \\
$D_l$ the diameter of the lens, \\
$L_f$ the opacity of the bandpass filter, and \\
$L_l$ the effective opacity of the optics. This calculation is performed in \cref{tab:effective_noise_power}.

The next step is to calculate the number of background noise photons per second ($PPS_B$) that are detected by each SPAD. For that, one first needs to know the energy of a single photon $E_{photon}$. To calculate $E_{photon}$ one can use \cref{eq:energy_photon}. The calculation of this is shown in \cref{tab:energy_photon}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:energy_photon}
	E_{photon} &= \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\end{align}

\input{tab/energy_photon_tab}

The SPAD Array is assumed to be $2500\times4$ for a total of $N_{SPAD} = 10000$.
Now to calculate the $PPS_B$ for each SPAD one can use \cref{eq:PPS_B}

\begin{align}\label{eq:PPS_B}
	PPS_B &= \frac{P_B'\cdot PDP}{E_{photon}\cdot N_{SPAD}}
\end{align}
where $PDP$ is the photon detection probability of the SPADs. This calculation is done in \cref{tab:PPS_B}

\input{tab/PPS_B_tab}
