\subsection{Detected photon characterisation}\label{ssec:HDM_detected_photon_characterisation}
This section is similar to \cref{ssec:detected_photon_characterisation}, but recalculates parts that are different for the HDM mode. First of all, the results of all the SPAD measurements are no longer bundled together, but interpreted seperately. Also the device is a lot closer to Europa with an altitude of at most $500\,m$ which causes the laser to be me more effective when compared to the noise. The new values to work with are shown in \cref{tab:photons_per_SPAD}. Note that the $PPS_S$ is the amount of photons per Watt of optical transmitted energy.

Another important changed property, is that the maximum time of flight $t_{round}=3.33\,\mu s$. This directly means that per measurement, less noise is received. However, the expected amount of noise per bin remains the same. The new $\mu_n=\frac{3.33\cdot10^{-6}}{2}=1.67\,\mu s$, and the new $\sigma_n=\frac{3.33\cdot10^{-6}}{\sqrt{12}}=304\,ns$.
