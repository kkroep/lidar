\section{Scanning motion}\label{ssec:scanning_motion}
In \cref{ssec:SPADs}, it was concluded that a SPAD array with one SPAD per pixel is not feasable. Therefore a scanning motion is required. Possible scanning motions for different SPAD array configurations are shown in \cref{tkz:scanning_motions}. Note that the $2048\times1$ motion is in essense a special case of the $2048\times N$ motion, where exactly one row of pixels is observed at a time. The $M\times N$, with $M<2048$ and $N<2048$ needs a scanning motion in both x and y direction. This makes the scanning motion very complicated and unreliable. Therefore only the family of solutions with $2048\times N$ with $N<2048$ wuill be considered.
